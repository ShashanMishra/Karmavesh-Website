                <p> Over 5, 50,000 engineers graduate every year from more than 1500
                    colleges across India but 75% of engineering students in India are
                    unemployable according to the studies of Nasscom.

                    </p>
                    <p> According to Aspiring
                    Minds study 2012 less than one fifth of India's engineers have the
                    necessary skills required to get placed in major IT firms.
                    The main reason behind this problem is that skill
                    building, practical training, and awareness about latest career trends
                    has not been given equal importance as academics by colleges. As a
                    result the students does not realizes the importance of having
                    practical knowledge which is essential along with theoretical
                    concepts. They develop a mentality that by excelling in academics and
                    being a topper in class is enough to become an engineer and to prove
                    their intelligence. Even most of the parents does not ask anything
                    other than marks. The minds of students are more occupied with
                    maintaining attendance, assignments and academics. Education obtained
                    only from bookish knowledge might not be enough for an engineer to
                    sustain at workplace environment where skill and creativity is
                    required. Even if the high scoring students are placed well eventually
                    the lack of practical knowledge and exposure catches up and after that
                    companies either provide them training if the student has some
                    potential otherwise he/she is simply rejected. An average student
                    spends 4 years in B.tech and gets superficial knowledge on around
                    40-45 subjects, hardly getting expertise in any of them. As a result in
                    4th year they find themselves among million fresh engineering
                    graduates most of them struggling to get a job. In addition many
                    students disappointingly realize that an offer letter no longer
                    guarantees a job. What’s the point in having an offer if you don't have
                    the joining date?</p>

working professionals,developing soft skills,providing an insight into
their future workplace and awareness about various opportunities after

can compete at par with other graduates from IITs and the like colleges
from across the country and world. Their pro-active measures right from
initial years of college will help them performing better in this
