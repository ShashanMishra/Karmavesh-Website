                <span class="light-text main-color">Karmavesh,</span>
            </h2>
           
                <p> the official council of BBDGEI organised an introductory event for the freshers on 11th of August, between 1 pm to 2 pm in  the main block of BBDNITM, to provide a fresh kick start to their brand new academic curriculum with a twist.</p>
                <br>

				<p>Interrogation, the event was conducted with the objective to gauge the broad horizons of a sophomore’s intelligence quotient and to know their capabilities and areas of interest. We at Karmavesh have always empowered and aided such budding talent to vigorously showcase their strengths by giving up on their inhibitions, hence we annually come up with this one of its kind event through which after learning about the multifarious persona of our freshly college joined bunch of aspirants provide them the right direction and flow of guidance in order to help them reach the apt destination and settle for the rightly deserved position.</p>
				<br>

				<p>We interacted with the 1st years in order to understand their mindset as well as college expectations and to provide them a window so as to what lies ahead in time for them in the college campus. We tried easing the pressure of our new college mates by talking about their academics as well as co-curricular activities. We made a note of their non-academic needs and helped by giving them the right advice as senior members of the college’s student council. We responsibly interacted directly with the freshers as well as distributed a small set of questions in order to learn about the few who were not fluid in conversing due to their shy nature.</p>
				<br> 

				<p>The questionnaire which was distributed during the session involved questions pertaining to current affairs as well as general ability measuring written exercises. The voluntary approach of the first year students enabled them to answer the questions related to both the areas with much more ease than that we had thought of. Many students exhibited the capability of lucidly, confidently expressing themselves and their opinions publically with almost no question or sign of fear of expression on their faces, which further helped encouraging others of the same batch to stand up and indulge into this brief activity which provided them the right amount of exposure intermingled with the apt amount of interaction.</p>
				<br>

				<p>Through this event three promising candidates were shortlisted and awarded as promised. On witnessing the records and response recorded, we concluded that our event had surpassed the meter limit for success that we had set for ourselves to achieve.</p>
				<br> 

				<p>Karmavesh gladly quotes that with the effective work approach and timing strategy, we were able to achieve what we had objectified as the sole purpose of Interrogation, 2015 as well as the positive and refreshing interaction with newly admitted 1st years and help them acquire immense inspiration to work harder for making their journey worthwhile in the college campus apart from the promising academic curriculum guaranteed by our reputed faculty members.</p>
